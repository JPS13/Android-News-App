# Android-News-App

  This project was completed as part of the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree. The user is prompted to enter search text which is used to build a url to query the Guardian News API for related articles. The JSON response is then displayed in a list view using the ViewHolder pattern for efficiency. The HTTP request is handled on a background thread to avoid slowing the UI thread.
